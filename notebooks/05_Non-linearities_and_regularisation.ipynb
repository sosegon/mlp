    "\n",
    "In the previous lab notebook we explored the issue of overfitting. There we saw that this arises when the model is 'too complex' ($\\sim$ has too many degrees of freedom / parameters) for the amount of data we have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method for trying to reduce overfitting is therefore to try to decrease the flexibility of the model. We can do this by simply reducing the number of free parameters in the model (e.g. by using a shallower model with fewer layers or layers with smaller dimensionality). More generally however we might want some way of more continuously varying the effective flexibility of a model with a fixed architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common method for doing this is to add an additional term to the objective function being minimised during training which penalises some measure of the complexity of a model as a function of the model parameters. The aim of training is then to minimise with respect to the model parameters the sum $E^\\star$ of the data-driven error function term $\\bar{E}$ and a model complexity term $C$.\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We need the complexity term $C$ to be easy to compute and differentiable with respect to the model parameters. A common choice is to use terms involving the *norms* ($\\sim$ a measure of size) of the parameters. This penalises models with large parameter values. Two commonly used norms are the L1 and L2 norms. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a $D$ dimensional vector $\\mathbf{v}$ the L1 norm is defined as\n",

The $\\frac{1}{2}$ term is less universal and is sometimes not included; we include it here for consistency with how we defined the sum of squared errors cost.

The `coefficient` propert of these classes should be used as the $\\beta_i$ value in the equations above. The parameter the penalty term (or gradient) is being evaluated for will be either a one or two-dimensional NumPy array (corresponding to a vector or matrix parameter respectively) and your implementations should be able to cope with both cases."

    "\n",
    "One simple way to use data augmentation is to just statically augment the training data set - for example we could iterate through the training dataset applying a transformation function like that implemented above to generate new artificial inputs, and use both the original and newly generated data in a new data provider object. We are quite limited however in how far we can augment the dataset by with a static method like this however - if we wanted to apply 9 random rotations to each image in the original datase, we would end up with a dataset with 10 times the memory requirements and that would take 10 times as long to run through each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to randomly augment the data on the fly as we iterate through the data provider in each epoch. In this method a new data provider class can be defined that inherits from the original data provider to be augmented, and provides a new `next` method which applies a random transformation function like that implemented in the previous exercise to each input batch before returning it. This method means that on every epoch a different set of training examples are provided to the model and so in some ways corresponds to an 'infinite' data set (although the amount of variability in the dataset will still be significantly less than the variability in all possible digit images). Compared to static augmentation, this dynamic augmentation scheme comes at the computational cost of having to apply the random transformation each time a new batch is provided. We can vary this overhead by changing the proportion of images in a batch randomly transformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of this scheme has been provided for the MNIST data set in the `AugmentedMNISTDataProvider` object in the `mlp.data_providers` module. In addition to the arguments of the original `MNISTDataProvider.__init__` method, this additional takes a `transformer` argument, which should be a function which takes as arguments an inputs batch array and a random number generator object, and returns an array corresponding to a random transformation of the inputs. \n",
